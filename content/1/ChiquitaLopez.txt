variations on the teror came to me in a dream<br>
it was the Horse of Ilios taking a damn on<br>
the human kind grooming itself the same way<br>
I did leaving it’s girlfriend for me, can you imagine?<br>
friendship material, actually in your hands<br>
have ejculate in your muth? better that than skein<br>
crushing a human skull because it is your enemy<br>
blinding humns eyes because they are a-looking<br>
to be vanquished & not surrender, this is victory

glow gore &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while it is a botgra well   if it isn’t a gor<br>
variations on a throne that is a mirror full of sords<br>
he knew well his girlfriends wooden leg before they buried her<br>
he was always chasing her across nothumberland<br>
with his dogs daisy & co & dusey & daint<br>
they would pallyfully nip at her legs & heart<br>
they would tom poe, and the girl who fell who would<br>
ask for loads of money, which he would give, being<br>
heir to the north, but he would do other things
