<p>
a blood red bird of fmale representation<br>
on television<br>
prhaps you’ve not been watching, recently?<br>
arranged each Dte to mark each year<br>
& on the 14th a preset<br>
odd dobl pntration<br>
but themargins to negotiate<br>
to hear the corridor catch a future call<br>
a need for dental records<br>
infection antipathy<br>
broken city borne from the eyes down<br>
look away from the a happy time soured<br>
she can’t recall the second guys name<br>
in broad century as dark is grown brightly?<br>
such a busy time, people wise<br>
numbers wise
</p>
<p align="right">
a blood red female room is probable?<br>
mayb in years on television<br>
prhaps you’ve been watching that happn<br>
arranged each day to mark each date<br>
& on the 15th a present<br>
of caling yr bluff<br>
in a cupboard beneath bearded bulls <br>
a nightmare o having of a cage<br>
fragile neck<br>
a need for dentl record identification<br>
opposition aversion<br>
looking only out of curiosity<br>
but ruin the second guys name<br>
in broad century as dark as grown brightly?<br>
such a busy timewise<br>
a happy time soured<br>
she can’t recall
