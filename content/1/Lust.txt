<p>
As a seductive little planet,<br>
Whose magnetism seeps through;<br>
I the travelling comet,<br>
Can't do nothing but head towards you.
</p>
<p>
Straining every nerve to think straight;<br>
To keep on treading the rational path,<br>
But here comes this marvel that won't wait;<br>
Unleashes an erotic wrath:
</p>
<p>
Craving to smack her, bend her, declaring her mine;<br>
Make herÂ leak, make her peak;<br>
Make her speak in a whole different tongue.<br>
Tune her until an ode upon your devotion moaning shall be sung.
