The man lies down with ‘Under The Bridge’. He puts his<br>
head on Auden. The other puts their head on DH Lawrence <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(They have fallen from a <br>
chessboard.) They are under <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <br>
truck that will never reach <br>
Australia. Be tender: one has a long beard. The man thinks <br>
about having a mind. About how Auden and DH Lawrence brought <br>
him here. About how other songs structure feelings for the song <br>
you’re actually with, and how the ground becomes yet another party<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone might come along: Freud might enter the picture. Some <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piece <br>
of chicken-shit legislation (liberalising or restricting). There was <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so much <br>
in Auden’s and Lawrence’s heads they’d found it difficult <br>
to lift them, but death had refined them and <br>
their minds. The man tries to not to think <br>
so much. ‘Under The Bridge’ appears not to be <br>
thinking at all. There is music: the noise of <br>
voices and graffiti artists. The man begins to question which Auden <br>
is supporting him, how early? ‘Under The Bridge’ could be acting <br>
out a scene. He feels as if his head is reading <br>
Auden in the dark. A poem titled ‘Lunch Is A Stranger’<br>
a Brechtian melodrama. He strokes the long beard until it <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whitens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t turn your back, they say together. Faithfulness enters the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;picture
