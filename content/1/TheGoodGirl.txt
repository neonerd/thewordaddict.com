<p>
Middle of the room<br>
on my knees<br>
torn buttons hide nothing<br>
from a gaze
</p>
<p>
A word meant to obey<br>
pain meant to please<br>
and soaked lace<br>
from gratefull tears
</p>
<p>
Laughter and a hiss<br>
three steps closer to bliss<br>
Shivering puppy<br>
lust is a disease
</p>
<p>
sick from the orders<br>
that step on the pride<br>
and sick from the self<br>
that loves the whip and loves deep<br>
the swinging hand in the night.
