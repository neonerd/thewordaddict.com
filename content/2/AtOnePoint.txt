<p>
At one point, I found great support in ‘intersujectivity’.<br>
- Knowledge of isolation and desperately incommunicable experience<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; takes on a different shade in light of event/connection/relationship<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the bigger the gates of determination<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the less does not remain to be communicated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and under the bluelight veil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of intuitive good<br>
<em>(joy is also intuitive)</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything makes sense<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has sense.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “if at least every hundredth line quivers every hundredth heart”<br>
– Oldřich Mikulášek, Czech poet.<br>

<b><u>every hundredth can’t always be enough, well, sometimes, at least<br>
but with the world’s imperfections the problem has to be in me<br>
So tell me, what the fuck should I deconstruct<br>
and how far do we have to go!</u></b>
