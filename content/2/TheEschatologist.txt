<p>
As I approach the end of the world<br>
I realize drinking soya milk won’t help me,<br>
even chewing gums in plastic cans<br>
won’t do the trick.
</p>
<p>
It is here.<br>
It is fast, fastest, faster<br>
than ever before.
</p>
<p>
And I, a ghost in the shell…<br>
No copyright issues there.<br>
It has become a cliché.
</p>
<p>
Ticks and tocks,<br>
time sounds like a bomb<br>
and bomb is what essentially a Bible is.<br>
Open up the book now,<br>
after years of short-circuiting<br>
and not realizing;
</p>
<p>
open me now as you open yourself,<br>
as you squeeze my obsidian heart<br>
and my silicone breasts,<br>
open my monochrome legs,<br>
your end of world is there, my sex
</p>
<p>
doesn’t really matter when planets clash.<br>
Future turns against us – <br>
our own creation, little infant<br>
that was promising, a star,<br>
self-distinguishing,<br>
acidic as the ocean,<br>
the deathbed of all I am.
</p>
<p>
There goes a hand, an eye blink,<br>
there – a metal chest,<br>
some things float, some sink.
</p>
<p>
The me, the us,<br>
we accelerate in lust,<br>
coupling, finishing, eruptions of dust,<br>
crave for a past,<br>
yet re-send selfhood<br>
to obliterate,<br>
extend <br>
as plasmonic nanoparticles<br>
in the uterus of the futuristic mother.<br>
She is…
</p>
<p>
You name her.<br>
I am at a dead-end.
