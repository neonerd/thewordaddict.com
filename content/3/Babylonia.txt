<em>“I was born in a system that doesn't give a fuck<br>
About you nor me nor the life... <br>
Don't be a victim of things I do to survive; <br>
Cause I won't wish you any good, you Babylonians.”</em>

</p>
<p>
You Babylonians that stick together,<br>
in the arena the universe is –<br>
all varieties of you stand out.<br>
Brick by brick you bring on your backs<br>
to prove to someone far above<br>
how superb a crowd can be.<br>
Organic and organized, you place stones<br>
from the mills of your souls<br>
to make your towers grow like trees.<br>
You build forests of dynasties, happily,<br>
as if there are no knives at your necks<br>
or ropes around your mice-like hands.<br>
Yet full of sand, your teary eyes<br>
try to glimpse a trace of rain<br>
to wash away your faces, your identity.<br>
So one day, and for a million years after<br>
it was god himself who answered your cries.<br>
He gave you different eyes,<br>
to look at heights<br>
that never were the same.<br>
Some now flew far,<br>
others gathered fallen feathers.<br>
While apart you grow stronger,<br>
little rats in a circle race,<br>
until the stars burst in genesis flames<br><
and destroy all humble illusions<br>
of affection, morality and<br>
your immortality.<br>
What will we be then?<br>
Nothing more than different sand grains<br>
on the deathbed of the endless<br>
blue and gray.<br>
Hey you, Babylonians, that erect voices<br>
from the depths of the ocean -<br>
don't you know you are a part of the system?
