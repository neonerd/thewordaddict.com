<h3>i don't wanna have it</h3>
<p> 
they dig the empty ground and die<br>    
and they hog fat when they are hungry<br>   
the skin smells like the skinned ones<br>    
i don't wanna have the food i don't wanna have the soil<br>   
i know how the pig felt like<br>   
i don't wanna have its pain and the worries<br>    
</p>

<h3>in a fish</h3>
<p> 
i will die in a fish then people get me<br>    
when we all land we feed the fish with alga<br>    
then they digest me in a fish then we all born in a fish<br>    
</p>

<h3>jigsaw</h3>
<p> 
its mouth was made of jigsaw<br>    
it made me see it did not have teeth<br>    
it made me see he made me see he doesn't have<br>    
teeth it did not have teeth his mouth was made<br>    
of jigsaw<br>    
</p>

<h3>the neck of my duck</h3>
<p> 
we selected a female with dad<br>    
and raised her with love<br>    
one exception of them<br>    
he led her kids struck dead<br>    
he was not able to do it<br>    
took even a stray dog earlier<br>    
it's odd to see the chicken<br>    
they move long after the axe strikes<br>     
the Dalmatian killed also chicken<br>    
had a beautifl aristocrat's pose<br>    
dad striked him on the neck with an iron<br>    
he yelped in the end of the chain and has gone by<br>    
but dad was not able to stomach the duckling<br>    
because I gave a name to him<br>    
I shot the sparrows one after the other<br>    
once even a fluffy nestling<br>    
then dad grew weak<br>     
and removed tearful the corpse<br>    
the black piggy was my favourite<br>    
he was skinny and human-like<br>    
I was looking for him until the time<br>    
he was forgotten like everyone<br>    
The neck of my duck was cut off<br>    
The neck of the hen is cut off<br>    
The neck of my dog was broken<br>    
the throat of the animals is cut off<br>   
</p>

<h3>THEY COME</h3>
<p> 
moles plut under the city<br>    
they pluck the roots<br>    
the street crumbles in<br>    
the hedges stop in the pothole<br>    
the window boxes vanish<br>    
they chew the cables through<br>    
no more light<br>    
no more gas<br>    
farmers come<br>    
peasants come<br>    
they put them out with a shovel<br>    
cut the heads off with it<br>    
on tuesday the dustmen<br>    
throw them in containers<br> 
</p>   
<p> 
foxes roam the gardens<br>    
seize the neck of blackcocks<br>    
drag along the chickens<br>    
into the woods<br>    
pile up the plunders<br>    
into a tower<br>    
the dead fowl reach each other<br>    
they pull the undermost out<br>    
roll about it in soil<br>    
spit its feather out<br>    
its liver for the children<br>    
head for the father<br>    
body for the family<br>   
</p>

<h3>untitled</h3>
<p> 
Through the gaps of the shutter we see the nearby ones<br>   
and the outlaw time travellers<br>   
We can see the grove, where fields met once<br>   
the woman croons from the last one<br>   
so clearly that our heart breaks<br>   
the white tykes are tied up/bound<br>   
their chains raffle in canon through the streets<br>   
everything happens simultaneously<br>   
we do’t know whether to keep it as a memory<br>   
or wait for the next one<br>   
all we know, is to be infected at the time of harvest<br>   
we produce daytime and nighttime<br>   
as if it would be our own land<br>   
our commitment is evident<br>  
</p>
<p>
though we are the collective farm<br>   
which smells like iron and the city<br>   
is only the disillusioned welder’s locker<br>  
</p>
