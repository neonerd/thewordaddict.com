**Gender**

He, She and They went for a trip into the country. It should be noted that the character hereafter known as “They” is, and was, in fact contentedly cis-gendered 99% of the time. However, for these five or six hours, on a hill in central Europe, They were faced with what Their psilocybin-addled brain saw as the epitomes of Masculinity and Femininity. For instance, He removed his shirt to reveal a strong, ape-like physique, and dedicated His trip to overtly masculine tropes. He acted out hunting, shouted out orders to an invisible army and gave instructions to a gym class that only he could see. She lay amongst the grassy borders of the scree-pile that they called home for well over half of the trip; She became one with the nature that surrounded them, a totem of fertility and rebirth. Indeed, She was reborn in a way through that trip. But what did They see? They saw this binary of genders, one obviously male and one obviously female… And They were neither. They saw this, They saw their incompatibility with either, and They saw the end of the world. 

**Rocks**

The three of them pulled themselves up the hill, a symbolic addition to the trip on His part and a requirement to the other two. She was beginning to see too many exaggerations in the actions of others while They were beginning to see crocodiles in the tarmac. On top of the hill there was a construction site which had gone along with the Wall and had been abandoned for decades; a private playground for the group. Easily broken rubble was piled around the edges and in the centre were a series of piles and pits made up of larger bricks, wires and slabs of concrete. Still struggling slightly to understand Their surroundings, They picked up one of the softer lumps of rubble from the ground and snapped it in two. The sadness They felt as a result still occasionally hits Them at unexpected times.
When They heard Her say ‘He got a rock!’ They looked round to Him. He had a rock; what had he expected?

**Snails**

i had a sudden stroke of megalomania and declared that ‘i want to be king of the snails!’ we were lying on the scree, propped up by a pile of rubble and watching our jester/monkey leaping gracefully from heap to heap of detritus. i found a cigarette and was about to light it when something distracted me; so i said again ‘i want to-’ when she interrupted saying ‘but i’m king of everything.’ this was a fair point so i asked, out of curiosity, if she would let me be king of the snails if i paid her a tax of a snail a day; she agreed and to celebrate i got very close to lighting my cigarette before putting it back in the packet and joining the jester/monkey in his game.

**Tableaus**

Gods of Rubble. When They turned a corner after spending what could have been any amount of time inspecting some faces that had grown out of the clay, They saw that He and She had arranged themselves beautifully. He was on Their right with the sky behind him, grass slowly giving in to rubble at his feet and the rope and metal tail of some Cold War beast in his hand. She was to Their left, softly silhouetted against the coming dusk, with the rubble of man’s world at Her feet.
