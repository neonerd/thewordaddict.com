<p> 
we selected a female with dad<br>    
and raised her with love<br>    
one exception of them<br>    
he led her kids struck dead<br>    
he was not able to do it<br>    
took even a stray dog earlier<br>    
it's odd to see the chicken<br>    
they move long after the axe strikes<br>     
the Dalmatian killed also chicken<br>    
had a beautifl aristocrat's pose<br>    
dad striked him on the neck with an iron<br>    
he yelped in the end of the chain and has gone by<br>    
but dad was not able to stomach the duckling<br>    
because I gave a name to him<br>    
I shot the sparrows one after the other<br>    
once even a fluffy nestling<br>    
then dad grew weak<br>     
and removed tearful the corpse<br>    
the black piggy was my favourite<br>    
he was skinny and human-like<br>    
I was looking for him until the time<br>    
he was forgotten like everyone<br>    
The neck of my duck was cut off<br>    
The neck of the hen is cut off<br>    
The neck of my dog was broken<br>    
the throat of the animals is cut off<br>
