<p> 
moles plut under the city<br>    
they pluck the roots<br>    
the street crumbles in<br>    
the hedges stop in the pothole<br>    
the window boxes vanish<br>    
they chew the cables through<br>    
no more light<br>    
no more gas<br>    
farmers come<br>    
peasants come<br>    
they put them out with a shovel<br>    
cut the heads off with it<br>    
on tuesday the dustmen<br>    
throw them in containers<br> 
</p>   
<p> 
foxes roam the gardens<br>    
seize the neck of blackcocks<br>    
drag along the chickens<br>    
into the woods<br>    
pile up the plunders<br>    
into a tower<br>    
the dead fowl reach each other<br>    
they pull the undermost out<br>    
roll about it in soil<br>    
spit its feather out<br>    
its liver for the children<br>    
head for the father<br>    
body for the family<br>   
</p>
