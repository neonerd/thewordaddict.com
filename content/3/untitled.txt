<p> 
Through the gaps of the shutter we see the nearby ones<br>   
and the outlaw time travellers<br>   
We can see the grove, where fields met once<br>   
the woman croons from the last one<br>   
so clearly that our heart breaks<br>   
the white tykes are tied up/bound<br>   
their chains raffle in canon through the streets<br>   
everything happens simultaneously<br>   
we do’t know whether to keep it as a memory<br>   
or wait for the next one<br>   
all we know, is to be infected at the time of harvest<br>   
we produce daytime and nighttime<br>   
as if it would be our own land<br>   
our commitment is evident<br>  
</p>
<p>
though we are the collective farm<br>   
which smells like iron and the city<br>   
is only the disillusioned welder’s locker<br>  
</p>
