Characters
Nigarous - a sauvage played by Benecio del Toro
Rigarous – a dandy fop played by Kyle McLachlan

[Rigarous has just made landfall at a pristine tropical beach and has ran into one of the locals. The masted ship can be seen anchored just beyond the calm, bright blue waters. Ensuing ensues.]

Rigarous: Hello there!
Nigarous: Who dat'?
R: Tis I.
N: [looking around, jolted] Woo?
R: Foolish mongrel, 'tis I that am here. You merely complete the picture. An urchin, there in the corner of the  masterpiece, turned upwards toward your true identity which is..... I, RIGAROUS.
N: Wat' you want? Who yo' daddy?
R: My father is the greatest father of all the fathers, a real father in your cap and don't you forget it. Watches over me, loves me, and bestows success only on those derservèd. I love you Dad!
[changes voice] I love you son! Go get 'em!
N: [perplexed] That was you that thar' voice.
R: No it wasn't.
N: [pause] You crazy... an ya'll soggy. How you been survivin' out here? Ain't a picknic..
R: [half aside] or isn' it?

*Rigarous starts walking around, measuring, surveying, partitioning - a king come to his own 	land. Picks a flower, smells it, throws it away.*

R: Well, regardless, this land is just about mine now, as soon as...
N: What?
R: Er.. I don't quite know. Anyway consider yourself subjugated.
N: Yes, subdijadid.
R: Sub-ju-ga-ted.
[pause]
Nigarous: There's a meal on. You got somethin fo' youself hea'?
Rigarous: [benevolent laugh] Hohoho

*Rigarous seems self-content.*

N: I like rabbits meself. Only hard to catch 'em. Gotta be real smart, an' real quiet, an' then BOOM, you got one squirming in your hands until you wring it so hard that it just twitches, an then you know you got 'im for the cookin'.

*Rigarous not listening, cutting down tree while whistling a merry tune. Chop chop.*

N: Hey why you doin' dat? What you doin' here anyway? Where yo' momma?
R: Ahhhh, yes, my poor dear mother, my only true love. Women are but a pale image of that shining motherly beauty that is my mother's. She is holy you know...
N: ...
R: [continues] So much pain in those birth pangs of hers, so much love for me. Gave her child to the greater good, so to speak. For which mother doesn't feel the pain and shock of her little infant as it makes its way into the outside world, forever separated from the womb which gave it life...

*Rigarous resumes chopping at the tree, whistling.*

N: My momma is just over them hill. We gotta nice place there, no spiders neither. Water is as close as you want it. Cousin made dat ditch, an its workin' juss fine too. He make some good meal... but what you doin' thar'?
R: ...
N:  I say, what you doin thar'?!
R: Chopping, boy.
Nigarous: Dat our tree, you know. Dat my forest here! [seems riled]
Rigarous: [suddenly concerned] Yes, it is, isn't it? Well, we have to agree, right? Agreeing is the most important thing.
N: Er..yea.
R: You wouldn't want to argue, ohnonono. And me neither, we are all civil here, right? Your grand er.... [looking around] home. Yes, like those beads you have there around your neck. Show them to me, they are MAGNIFICENT!
N: Hm. My sister made 'em for me, befo' last month's match. I knocked him good! [guttural laugh]
R: Yes, yes, well, we all want to agree. You just come sit over here. Here's a banana.
N: Alright!
[eating the banana]
R: Now, we're all friends here, we all agree.
N: Hm.
R: And because we're such good friends, we should affirm that friendship, make a pact that will make us stronger, more bold, more prosperous. So why not right?
N: WHAA'?!
R: Exactly! So here's a little paper that I have here, and its only for my very best friends to sign, you dig, only those! None of them greasy crab-eaters across the bay right? You don't darn like 'em neither, do ya'?
N: Them mastivites, I hates 'em. I kill if they come near. This here mine, I lives from it. Mine! [panting, shaking fist across water]
R: Yes, they are eldritch, filthy men, whose wives cavort with sea monsters. They are a disgrace. And both you and I must be stronger to fight them. If we make friends, we grow stronger. Be my friend, dear Nigarous; be my comrade in war, just as in peace!
N: Yaaaaayy.
R: Now, to commemorate this moment, you sign here.
N: Wat sine?
R: Sign.
N: Wat you want?
R: Sign.
N: I sine.
R: No, you must 'sign' it.
N: I 'sign'.

*Nigarous smiles sheepishly across the contract at Rigarous*

R:Hm, the savage locals are craftier than at first suspected. I must recoup my losses, and return with a contract of men they won't be able to refuse. To the perp mobile!

*Rigarous recedes ninja-style across the beach, contract in pocket, back to his three-mast ship seen anchored just beyond the cove and its aquamarine waters.*

Nigarous: [sits for a while, ponderous] It's dem' crabs that done all thar fussin'.

*Nigarous gets up and walks over and beyond the small hill which borders the beach, back towards his small village, and his ma' and cousins, and life ahead.*
