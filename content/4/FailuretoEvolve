<p>
If people didn't act like fucking swine<br>
the world would be a sweeter sort of place<br>
of quality, and dignity, and grace<br>
if we were just a little more refined<br>
</p>

<p>
But human beings are a vulgar breed<br>
(Vulgar, from the Latin: common folk)<br>
our flames of passion pooter out in smoke<br>
once we have fulfilled our basic needs<br>
</p>

<p>
The young man speaks of hearts that beat as one<br>
flowers in Spring, the singing of the birds<br> 
and there is poetry in his sweet words<br> 
but then he leaves as soon as he is done<br>
</p>

<p>
Having risen from primordial ooze<br>
you'd think that we would want to raise our sights<br>
improve our minds, move up to greater heights<br>
but...we're satisfied with cigarettes and booze<br>
</p>

<p>
Though we have Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms<br>
whenever you turn on the radio<br>
it's something, something, something, fucking ho<br> 
no moving arias, uplifting psalms<br>
</p>

<p>
Everybody says they love good food 
but when we're hungry, we don't want to wait
So we settle for what is second rate 
McDonald's usually satisfies our mood
</p>

<p>
The good defeats the perfect every time<br> 
it ain't so bad, it's mostly good enough<br>  
as long as we possess a lot of stuff<br>  
we have no need to search for the sublime<br> 
</p>

<p>
It would be noble to improve our souls<br> 
but we have sex, and drugs, and rock and roll<br> 
</p>
