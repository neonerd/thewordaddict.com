A puzzle for late returners<br> 
or a stumbling-block for the faithless,<br> 
latched or unlatched, no end<br> 
of push or pull will seem to shift<br> 
the Alice-sized fence:<br> 
immovable, it blocks the entry<br> 
that, earlier in the day, lay<br> 
open to all comers.<br> 
</p>

But when with a click<br>
the gate unexpectedly rolls<br>
to one side in its ingenious channel,<br>
we find ourselves — as if by a higher being<br>
granted sudden admission —<br>
in a world of symmetries:<br>
</p>

This step up to the terrace on the left<br>
where gameshows flick across the screen<br>
has an identical twin across the lawn<br>
whose doors are shut and sealed<br>
on nothingness;<br>
</p>

this door gives way to cooking and the scent of steam;<br>
this to the senseless dead, whose portions<br>
still wait for them upon the stoop;<br>
</p>

and we know<br>
this path, if followed far enough will lead<br>
through the towering gapura, *candi bentar*.<br>
</p>

On this side all the weight of the world:<br>
rough stone, rut, pig-trough, wrought-iron gate,<br>
bruised flesh;<br>
</p>

on this side, light as garden rain, the evening<br>
grey and amber like the colours<br>
of your sarong.<br>
</p>
