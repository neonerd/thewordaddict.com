the threat of death and thirst for power are the pathological forces behind cultural hegemony, that hegemony of white supremacist revisions of history across colonial and neocolonial medias.  there is a megalomaniacal pathology behind it, behind the narcissistic eroticism of the pornographic institutions that uphold this system of neo-colonial white supremacy, it’s similar to that of a rapist’s fantasy.  the metamedia narrative projects the story as the subject of the act, but also as the objectified by speaking for them, and then thirdly as the witness as well.  this is hegemonic terrorism, a perverted ecology under capitalism, in babylon.

censorship is what we’ll first present.  the foundation of censorship in the west can be said to have been set with aristotle and his work on generation and corruption -- this idea that some perversion of nature’s part can take place because we find it revolting or disgusting.  religion used to relieve this existential nausea, we can now say capitalism does.  this discomfort can be biolinguistically noted in the lyric vs post modern concept of poetry where conservative lyric poets and critics believe language poetry, and other post-modernist poetries, as not being viable to what the cannon accredits as “real” poetry.  but who cares really, to each his own. how does aristotle’s generation and corruption censor it’s own ideological death?

¨l erotisme ouvre a la mort.  la mort ouvre a la negation de la duree individuelle.  pourrions-nous, sans violence interieur, assumer un negation qui nous amene a la limite de tout le possible?¨ - bataille 

my thought: no, because there is ambiviolence, horror and fear.  fear of freedom and its pains .  you should have the outburst of violence and direct it towards yourself, but in a very specific way .  which way is that? there's nothing transcendental or escapist about this.  because that would mean denying its horror, the horror connected with earthy reality .

esoteric mysticism is raw.  morality judges and guides the mystical life  or mysticism guides and judges the moral life .  moral conduct and ethical judgement of the new york city based hip hop group, the wu tang clan, practice a certain kind of conduct informed by the ethical guide of the nation of the gods and the earths, a.k.a. the 5%ers, a.k.a. the poor righteous teachers.  it’s a form of esoteric mysticism derived from the nation of islam whose founding member broke off as a follower of Malcolm X, Clarence x13.  As a 5%er told me in conversation, if he wasn’t a 5%er he  would be a sufi.  they’re similar in many ways and the links between sufism and the 5%er.  but the nation of the god’s and earth’s is no religion, it’s a way of life.  let’s look at a lyric from a member of the wu-tang clan’s solo album, the rza’s bobby digital (1998).  the song is titled unspoken word, the lyric of the chorus goes: get your brains open, controlled emotion free will at the same token.  remember these words.  

**the ambiviolent sensuality of mysticism**

playing on batailles question of trying to pass the limits of experiential possibility,  if eroticism opens to death and death opens to the outer limits of experience it’s inevitable to see why censorship would consider eroticism as a sterile principle representing evil and the diabolic.  this is another ideological cover-up, in fact, the sight, the ability to see clearly, becomes sterile if the senses are only adept to one ideology and can’t decipher experience in any other way.  so mysticism provides other modes of decoding experience, and it leads us this way, “astray”, so to say, into temptation.

the peculiar quality of temptation is that the divine in its mystical form has ceased to be directly accessible on the sexual plane, the demonaic plane, as it were; this demonaic-divine or divine-demonaic offers what god himself, as he is discovered through major mystical experience, offers, and offers it more compellingly .

that offer is more compelling as a result of a change of perception, of the senses, and those senses can be said to be the extensions of sight, for “the general experience of the senses is the lust...of the eyes” .  lust is a curiosity.  augustine considered curiosity, that is, temptation, as sin.  heidegger was very interested in curiosity, idle talk and ambiguity.  i wonder if heidegger’s nazism was led by his temptation to find the program of the new science with the criminal fervour of a nazi.  It could be said that nazism did in 10 years what christianity did in 2000 years.  We’ll consider the technology of ethic later in regards to marshall mcluhan’s tetrad.  it’s tragically ironic how israel is racist and violently hostile towards not only the palestinians but also their own kind, the so called beta-jews, africans of jewish descent.  a possible ambiviolent resolution was stated (but not directly at israel) by zizek in the pervert’s guide to ideology while critiquing nazi symbolism in the music of the german band, rammstein:

**crowley: another kind of raw sacrifice** 

aleister crowley (1875-1947) was a magician and occultist from england. crowley was considered a drug addict and a satanist.  he was said to have participated in ritual murders, paedophelia and other degenerate activities.  we are not here to discuss the validity of these accusations.  crowley, like the rza’s group, the gravediggaz, represent a horror, a monstrosity, both beast and god.  i want to consider the depravity and disgust that make his infamous and reputation relevant for us.  he did after all take delight in writing scatological and pornographic poetry.  his drug activity could even be considered as part of an entheogenic education  which brings into question the morality of societies that consider themselves free, democratic and scientific and get to declaring plants illegal.  this type of drug induced education informs the somatic and mythical knowledge of self.   as the brother of the renowned ethnopharmacologist terrance mckenna, dennis mckenna, states “any consciousness that is not related to the production or consumption of material goods is stigmatized by our society today”.  so drugs are morally corrupt as well, as the american war on drugs tellingly failed.  what kind of morality is this shit?  Crowley sought a new form of ethic.  “We imagine that it is the stink of excrement that makes us feel sick.  But would it stink if we had not thought it was disgusting in the first place?  We do not take long to forget what trouble we go to to pass on to our children the aversions that make us what we are...we have to teach them by pantomime or failing that...curious aberration called disgust...a contagion passed down to us from the earliest men through countless generations of scolded children.  Our mistake is to take these teachings lightly” .

life is implicit in erotism  but censorship, corruption and terror all say no to nature, and hence to death, and hence no to free-willed reproduction.  why?  there is a difference between erotisme and reproduction, the difference will be noted later in this essay.  but the problem of reproduction for the ideology of white supremacy is woven into history through our medias.  we’ll also consider this idea later when examining lynching and the genital mutilation of blacks in the american south. 

one thing is for certain, as foucault said,  knowledge is power.  so who controls the knowledge has the power over those who use that knowledge.   by noticing the change in the definition of conspiracy theory definition: two or more ppl plotting to cause harm to someone else has been reversed by the media, where the media now has the authority, it’s no longer the people, the audience.  the reversal is like sacrifice without nausea: cattle being slaughtered or cut up often makes people sick today, but there is nothing in the dishes served at the tables to remind them of this.  So one might say of contemporary experience that it inverts pious conduct and sacrifice .  

this contemporary experience is also marked by edward bernays book on public relations.  bernays was the nephew of the father of psychoanalysis, sigmeund freud.  he brought the new psychoanalytical understanding of the mind to marketing and began to help corporations sell their products as dreams, experiences and godliness rather than the old “we make your clothes whiter, cleaner and we offer the best product for the job” marketing strategy.  now marketing didn’t just fulfill technical utility but more importantly it also fulfilled emotional desires.  (the corporations then transferred this technique to politicians).  

i wanted to present the idea of the kuleshov effect to further understand psychic implications of advertisement and marketing.  the kuleshov effect is named after the soviet filmmaker active in the 1910’s and 20’s.  he created montages of images that would result in the audience’s perception of one image being influenced by the other.  for example, he filmed an actor’s face then cut to a bowl of soup, then back to the same face, then to a beautiful woman, then to the same face then to a dead child.  if we thought of this as three separate sections and only saw one section at a time we would think the man looks hungry, or the man looked lustful, etc.  but it was the same face!  this technique has been transferred through medias to create and preserve the racial stereotypes we see being perpetuated and enforced today by pop culture and police profiling for probable cause, whether it be islamophobia, anti-black racism or any type of racism projected on to people of colour.  it’s beyond the scope of this essay to explore the psychological and philosophical inquiries of what is actually happening when this mechanism between images is activated in perception through montage.

the desires swayed by bernays’ influence are directed towards consumerism for capitalism.  but let’s face it, sacrifice just isn’t what it used to be.  it’s no longer nature, it’s censored and pornographic, there’s no more blood on our hands, only on our computer screens and news shows, in the movies and other medias.  and as bataille said, what we are served is nothing that resembles the horror of its production, ethical horrors that the average first world privileged person could never bear to experience in a third world environment.  

sated desires and fabricated security have oppressed curiosity, temptation and the mystical experience.  instead commercialism provides the drive towards consumerist epiphanies where the product somehow sacrifices itself for us and we turn to love it and give thanks for what it has done for us.  these aren’t sacrifices for the better, this is the loop of the many little deaths of one fabricated desire after the other.  desires fabricated and virtually summoned out of us in a mystical shopping experience as we are “prepared to sacrifice everything to this perverted duty of capitalism” .

sacrifice used to be a more immediate experience.  it replaced “the ordered life of the animal with a blind convulsion of the organs.  so also with erotic convulsion; it gives free reign to extravagant organs whose blind activity goes on beyond the considered will [of the lovers]...they are animated by a violence outside the control of reason...the urges of the flesh pass all bounds in the absence of controlling will” .  this is like the rza’s suggested free will (temptation, curiosity, improvisation) and controlled emotion (over nausea).  but free will has historically been oppressed by racism, genocide, colonisation and neo-colonialisation, because freedom hurts when the baby wants its rattle.

**what’s the threat of this in application?** 

the slave was forbidden, censored, from learning how to read by orders of the master.  to keep the slaves ignorant and divided.  this is the literal interpretation of what is happening.  consumerism and its vortex keeps us divided like the biblical story of the tower of babel.  how can this be metaphysically reproduced like prophecy?  there was a science to christianity, transferred to capitalism, we can see this happening through the reversed effects of censorship.  and as was earlier implied, there is a difference between eroticism and reproduction.  like eroticism has manifestations in death, reproduction does the opposite and manifests in a life, in this case, which is unsustainable, because without death there is no mysticism, curiosity into the real limitless boundaries of experience. 

the german 18th century archaeologist, johann blumenbach, invented race out of narcissism,  also out of the fear of the other and it’s assimilation of white supremacy, and there’s the power trip like the symptoms of a child in a freudian case study.  if you see charts below that were created by blumenbach, caucasian is at the top, categorized as superior to all other invented “races”.

there are many contemporary theories as to why the negroid, next to the indigenous, and now in more recent years the arab, (who traded places with the jew on the bottom of the race scale (and the jew was then allowed white privilege and upward mobility) after the second world war and white supremacy gained its middle eastern stronghold with israel), have been robbed of their self-determination and natural resources.  one of the many horrific forms the manifestations of this fear and oppression occurred was during the lynchings of african americans.  these lynchings often included genital mutilation and could be considered as a perversion of an erotic or reproductive phobia that inherently leads to death of identity.  fanon studied ideas of sex and racism in black skin white mask.  the violence became extroverted.  lynchings had their own media literature in the form of postcard pictures from lynchings that took place.  one thing for sure, as public enemy named their 1989 album, there is a “fear of a black planet”!  black jesus, black madonna, and because the history of cool in america, is the history of black, they must hegemonically control the cultural production of blacks so that what’s cool is no longer a threat to the established order.

the american government has spent its entire history trying to control and contain the african american population, since slavery, to jim crow laws, the klan, the slave patrols that turned into police.  they took down the black panthers, malcolm x, martin luther king (king got assassinated not when he was talking about race, but when he was protesting with waste management employees on strike in memphis and started to get involved with major economic implications).  then it escalated with the moral reverse of the war on drugs and the  bastards of the party and the era of gangster rap that had no leaders to look up to so that gangs and drugs proliferated and devastated communities.  it is an admitted fact that the c.i.a. helped import the cocaine that led to the crack-cocaine epidemic in american ghettos and urban communities.  it’s plausible that black or indigenous economic independence is the ultimate hegemonic threat to global white supremacy.  just look what happened to gaddafi when he wanted to form a central african bank and sell african oil with gold rather than with the american dollar.  he was taken down.  just as iraq was attacked when saddam hussein began trading his oil with the euro rather than the dollar.  all the meanwhile back at home cnn and other news medias are playing the war on terror all over the place.  the villainization of the middle east by the western media has spawned a whole new generation of islamophobia as a scapegoat to turn our attention away from “reality”.

this media literacy, this literary terrorism, extends into the schools and is known as linguicide involving indigenous residential schools in north america and in australian residential schools.  these christian schools took the indigenous children from their parents and communities and indoctrinated them with their jesus religion, forbade them to speak their native languages, cut their hair, children went missing, were murdered, sexually abused, beaten, all in the hands of the government and the church.  and this type of information isn’t in the history textbooks in elementary schools and high schools.  nothing is taught about the genocides, nothing to inform the generations upon generations of those who dwell on stolen native land of whose land they occupy and the horrors these people have endured so that there would be no apathy and the disgust at the treatment of our indigenous brothers and sisters would be turned to a moral, territorial and economic reparation. 

**the hegemonic metamedia narrative**

the reversals of conspiracy, of sacrifice, morality, eroticism, etc, are all applicable to marshall mcluhan’s tetrad.  these reversals are the nauseous xenophobias created by medias that dictate economics, education, entertainment, law, politics, religion, sex and (counter)war.  the ideologies of these medias and their portrayal in the media are constantly enhanced, reversed, retrieved and made obsolete according to the medias that govern the experience being projected for us, so that they may manipulate, oppress and thus terrorize us.  

**no conclusion, plans of action for decolonizing land and bodies**

glen coulthard’s book, red skin/white mask: rejecting the colonial politics of recognition (2014. university of minnesota press), addresses the problems of oil pipelines, territorial and environmental protection by members of indigenous communities and much of the struggles that the government refuses to acknowledge, including indigenous communities’ right self govern themselves.  it is the white supremacist myth that these people were too primitive to govern themselves before european contact.  his theories, supported by fanon and charles taylor’s works on recognition and acknowledgement, provide active models towards decolonization through ideas for implementation of first nations’ governments.  dwight dorey, national chief of the aboriginal congress in canada, also proposed an indigenous resource access accord in where  AT LEAST 1% of all revenues from the lands resources are put in a treasury or bank for indigenous communities.   

another fanonian scholar by the name of gordon lewis works on decolonizing knowledge, shifting the geography of reason and more contemporary relevance about fanon.  the work strives to collapse epistemic decadence, that is disciplinary decadence and the fetishization of method.  the interests result in stultifying institutions with no care for what kind of knowledge is produced but merely what knowledge/method is obeyed.  which knowledge will one subordinate themselves to?  this extends into media, movies and television like, oh, there can be people of colour, but they have to be this stereotype.  examples are basically all biblical movies, or more recently the hollywood blockbuster movie, exodus, in where the kings of egypt were europeans.  this white-washing is just detrimental and biolinguistically traumatizing because it perpetuates colonialism and its mechanisms of oppression. 

babylon tries to psychologically control self-determination and free will by selling ephemeral fantasies for quick fixes rather than sustainable ecologies.  this is nothing new.  even micah white's (co-creator of occupy wallstreet; former editor of adbusters) 2016 knopf press book, the end of protest: a new playbook for revolution, calls for the synthesis of subjectivism, theurgism, voluntarism and structuralism to alter the mental environment.  but the reminder is here, the recognition is marked and will be carried forward as intensities of this delusion accelerate towards its destruction.  by the calculative marketing surveillance of the all seeing eye that corrals us like cattle into entire cultural projections within the matrix of oppression.  this virtual reality is setup to control the thoughts of the multitudes.  this is a war machine and we must first realise how it works.  now the narrative script is being flipped on white supremacy, on patriarchy, colonialism, neo-colonialism and babylon!  these old bodies must die, it will be a series of little deaths, many times over.  wasn’t that the original risk to begin with?  death of identity, fear of cultural erasure and race?  we are moving beyond race!  we must first understand our traumas and negative dissonance from this neo-colonial cluster fuck.  there can be no more looking away in nauseous disgust.  it’s time to dig our way out of this shit!  best recognize!
