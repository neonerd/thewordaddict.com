<p>Welcome to the cyber world of the Word Addict </p>
<p>Please feel distracted enough to procrastinate by browsing through the latest issue (#3, Primitivism) of our ‘zine which is exploring its own crawl from the primordial ooze, the fingers reaching toward an unresponsive god.</p> 
<p>Both the beginning—the initial tribal state (or “state of war”)—and the end—breaking down of post-tech, post-human society—are the topics of this issue. The time when the human element is suppressed, and the primal let out. I don’t know why, but the word ‘visceral’ has been haunting my mind for quite some time now. And so, and on the suggestion of Vít Bohal, Primitivism became the focus of this issue.</p>
<p>To access the texts instantly, here are the choicest pieces: the author’s “Jelly”, Kinga Tóth’s poems, Fergus Doyle’s trippy account or Rick Reuther’s rumination.</p>
<p>We dig into the guts. We flay the flesh from the epidermis, burn through the dermis, and embrace the truly naked organ; it’s hideous, but it’s We and we say we love the human filth thus mined.</p>
