it was the Horse of Ilios taking a damn on<br>
the human kind grooming itself the same way<br>

have ejculate in your muth? better that than skein<br>
crushing a human skull because it is your enemy<br>
blinding humns eyes because they are a-looking<br>
to be vanquished & not surrender, this is victory
