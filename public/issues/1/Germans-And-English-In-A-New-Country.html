Valentin was a philosopher. A rock is not a thing<br>
he’d say. I am a thing to a rock. It<br>
was the time of ancestors as objects, of women taking <br>
men’s attitudes, of men doing women’s old jobs. Norma rode <br>
her bicycle along the rocky path, spurring it on. Annie <br>
took off her orange roof, her nephew Harold inside. Betty <br>
moved her pies and pictures. There was a mongoose nearby<br>
there were budgies fronting a tradition of thought. The closer<br>
Betty got the more thing-like the fauna, the more <br>
endangered. Valentin was a composer of grocery boxes. Mary <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell 
wore a broad hat and chatted to the kids of <br>
the convicts. The rock had dirt on it, the rained- <br>
on rock. These were not things. Ultimately, Valentin was no<br>
thing either, though he changed my name to something rarer<br>
   Ellen and Billy in the creek, sharing the surface of <br>
the earth. Ellen put her hand in under the creekbed<br>
feeling her hand go gold. When thought falls out of <br>
knowledge then imagination takes its place next to action<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentin <br>
became an English shadow. No: he became a snowman against <br>
a screen of eucalypt leaves. Mickey and Dave had whips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cows became convicts. Annie called it husbandry, but they <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did <br>
many things that weren’t. A ridge wouldn’t stand for it <br>
