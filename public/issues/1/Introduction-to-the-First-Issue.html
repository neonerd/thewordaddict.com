        <h1>Introduction to the First Issue</h1>
        <h3>by&nbsp;<em>Jaromir Lelek</em></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content"><p>The word ‘addict’ has rather negative connotations. What we are talking about, however, is a different kind of addiction, an addiction to the written word. It is quite alright to infuse your figurative syringe with a dose of fine prose and inject. </p>
<p>There is an art to the process. </p>
<p>The desire to consume what others produced ought not to be mindless consumption or a bloodless analysis, but rather, in Sontag’s spirit, a passionate engagement with the text. Shunning the phrase ‘erotics of art’ for fear of sounding needlessly provocative, compulsion for the logos we celebrate, appreciation of the book we preach and a bibliothḗkē growing exponentially is our flag. </p>
<p>—Welcome to the world of The Word Addict—</p>
<p>Each issue will have a set theme around which the contributions will revolve. This issue rotates around the Absorbing Girls/Guys, depiction of whom you may look for in the original texts—there is a lot of that pure, uncut, quality stuff to look forward to: a personal essay attempting to broach the subject, Farrell’s ruminations on absorbing heroes, Fowler’s experimental representations of absorbing heroines, the author’s poetic eccentricity, Stein and his two binary poems, and a confession that emerged from the depths of the female unconscious.</p>
