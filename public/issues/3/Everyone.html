      <div class="content"><p><strong>Everyone has the power to call your whole life into question here</strong></p>
<p>In creative greed, they’ve frightened us into thinking that we’re offensive and require lotions and potions to mask our natural odor. Every single society in history has seen a precipitous reduction in fertility following its achievement of a level of prosperity that allowed reasonable levels of education and emancipation. Other than that, your criticism may amount simply to getting unpleasant things out of your system. The absence of this order, the absence of cold when it ought to be cold, was something I now sensed as a sudden discomfort. How easy it would be, I thought, to slip gently into the water here, and go down into the depths. Did anyone really work at a utility company anymore? I wanted the voices silenced and I wanted less of my head generally. I didn’t want the arguments, and I didn’t want the voice that followed, the one that apologized, also silently, to the people I’d debated and dressed down. And thus it was until the Ganges decided to move. Though tragedy was in the process of becoming unreal and meaningless it seemed one was still permitted to remember the days when an individual life held some value and was not a mere misprint in a communiqué. Cameras are transfixed by figures such as Abu Hamza, the hook-handed imam from the Finsbury Park mosque. The physical landscape is baffling in its ability to transcend whatever we would make of it. At the same time the mind is trying to find its place within the land, to discover a way to dispel its own sense of estrangement. Sometime in the late 1970s I stopped being a persuaded positivist; imagine a carrot sliced so cleanly that the pieces stay there in place on the cutting board, still in the shape of a carrot. Consider also the bloody attempt by Russia at suppressing the Chechnyan Muslims. I can see the beauty of glass objects fully at the moment when they slip from my hand toward the floor. Soon, I could not think of a time or a behavior that was not symptomatic. On soft ground I left no tracks, but my footprints could be seen on hard rock; there were more samples of the product arranged on a tray at the conference table’s center. The very fact that we don’t know what debt is, the very flexibility of the concept, is the basis of its power. En dehors de cela, ils s&#39;intéressent aux problèmes techniques. Suddenly and totally, we’re threaded together in a network so terrifyingly colossal that we can finally see our terrifyingly tiny place in it. When bad things happened to other people, I imagined them happening to me. I didn’t know if this was empathy or theft. The revolution elevated to the throne the most mediocre of its leaders. It’s like when a toddler has a toy drum or piano and unconsciously taps away at it without a mote of annoyance from his seemingly copacetic father, right up until one random ordinary clang, which instantly dissipates the man’s patience and the keyboard ends up smashed. All night in darkness the water sped past.</p>
