<p>The Word Addict is a planetary literary magazine, provincially based in Prague. The mag spawned out of an obsessive love for words, an insatiable passion for literature and a craving to get it all out there. The author, Jaromír Lelek, an aspiring WNBA player, begs you to bear with him as he’ll try to make his stuff look legit.</p>
<p>Welcome to the self-deprecating world of the Word Addict.</p>
<p>The mag was created in an attempt to extract violent urges out of the author’s bosom, ‘brain’ &amp; loins. Once extracted, the particular subject (or, put pretentiously, ‘inner clash’) is then left for others to penetrate with their enquiries; like an egg laid out for intellectual insemination.</p>
<p>The aim is to shed light on that which has been <em>interesting</em>, amass varying views and synthesize that raw compound into an aesthetic bundle of interpretations, or a collection of approaches.</p>
<p>Collaboration is essential, since no single viewpoint is capable of fully beholding the truth. <em>Yes, this old concept.</em></p>
<p>To those shackled by obsolete notions of good and proper form, I should redirect your reading elsewhere. To those with the prerequisite cheek to critique, any comment is welcomed. To those who wonder at the pointlessness of existence, get over yourselves &amp; let’s have a pint of fine prose.</p>
<p>The Word Addict has gained an independent identity outside of itself, and has assumed the role of a character in the contemporary. ‘Tis a serialized novel in the act of being composed, in flagrante delicto, all across past issues and those yet to come. Acutely self-conscious, it is its own account of the creative process of tackling various layers of ‘reality’ and mag production.</p>
<p>The visual aspect of the magazine, admittedly, gets a hefty portion of editorial attention. Individually commissioned photo shoots illustrating the current topic of the issue have become an essential part of the Word Addict’s DNA. To those who’d critique this focus, I’d recommend waking the <em>fuck</em> up. Moreover, it isn’t mere polish aimed at attracting, but rather a complimentary method of approaching the topic via the method of photography. Fragmentarily united, we lay siege to the fort of the Truth, then get distracted and scribble experimental twaddle.</p>
<p>If you wish to get in on this (a rather questionable urge, if you ask me), just surf your cursor over to the “Submit” button and astonish us. Please, spell well.</p>
