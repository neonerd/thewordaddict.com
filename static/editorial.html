<p>Welcome to the cyber world of The Word Addict.</p>

<p>On the right you may freely browse through all the content of the past issues roughly categorised by genre and by the issue in which it appeared. You may also slip a shy peek into our gallery to see the artwork and the photos commissioned for the magazine.</p>

Reacting to the primitive slime of the last issue, to the polished surface we have ascended yet again. Lack of civil oxygen made it hard to breathe, and so we purchased your land, colonized the peasants, and privileged our way into your daughtersâ€™ laps. Aristocracy is a height in decline, an eternally ex-/imploding star; after all, no beautiful surfaces, as Friedrich had it, are conceivable without a terrible depth.</p>
